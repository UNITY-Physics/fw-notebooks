    "This script is designed to automate pulling processed data within a Flywheel project, providing real-time updates on progress and estimated completion time. It iterates through all subjects and sessions in a Flywheel project, searches for specific analysis files based on user-defined criteria, downloads these files, and aggregates the data into a single CSV. Additionally, it uploads the final results to the projectâ€™s information tab for easy access.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the process user-friendly, the script calculates the total number of steps at the beginning and, throughout execution, displays the percentage of completion and estimated time remaining. This allows users to monitor progress, especially useful when handling large datasets that may require significant time to process. Each part of the code is structured to help users understand how the data is managed, downloaded, and saved, ensuring both transparency and efficiency in data handling.\n"

    "# Walkthrough: Flywheel Data Processing Script\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing necessary libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Track Start Time\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "st = time.time()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This initializes a variable st to store the script's start time, allowing us to calculate the total runtime later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Preallocate Lists for Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = []\n",
    "sub = []\n",
    "ses = []\n",
    "acq = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "These lists are used to store downloaded data and relevant subject and session information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Calculate Total Steps\n",
    "To estimate completion progress, we first calculate the total number of subject-session combinations. This helps us know how many \"steps\" the script will take to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total_subjects = sum(1 for _ in project.subjects.iter())\n",
    "total_sessions = sum(1 for subject in project.subjects.iter() for _ in subject.sessions.iter())\n",
    "total_steps = total_subjects * total_sessions\n",
    "completed_steps = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Iterate Through Subjects and Sessions\n",
    "The main part of the script loops through each subject and session, processing data as it goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for subject in project.subjects.iter():\n",
    "    subject = subject.reload()\n",
    "    sub_label = subject.label\n",
    "    for session in subject.sessions.iter():\n",
    "        session = session.reload()\n",
    "        ses_label = session.label\n",
    "        completed_steps += 1  # Increment completed steps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Calculate Progress and Remaining Time\n",
    "Within each loop iteration, we calculate the percentage of completion and estimate the remaining time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elapsed_time = time.time() - st\n",
    "progress = (completed_steps / total_steps) * 100\n",
    "estimated_total_time = elapsed_time / (completed_steps / total_steps)\n",
    "remaining_time = estimated_total_time - elapsed_time\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Processing {sub_label}, {ses_label}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Progress: {progress:.2f}% | Estimated Time Remaining: {remaining_time / 60:.2f} minutes\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This provides the user with an ongoing update of the scriptâ€™s progress, helping them understand how much longer the script is likely to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Download and Process Analysis Files\n",
    "The script then checks if each session has a specific analysis file to download. If it finds the file, it downloads it and appends the data to our list df.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for analysis in session.analyses:\n",
    "    if analysis.gear_info is not None and analysis.gear_info.name == gear and analysis.gear_info.version == gearVersion and analysis.created > timestampFilter:\n",
    "        for analysis_file in analysis.files:\n",
    "            if fileName_tag in analysis_file.name:\n",
    "                # Download file and append data to `df`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Save and Upload Results\n",
    "Once all files are downloaded and combined into a DataFrame, the script saves the data to a CSV file. It then uploads the file to the project information tab in Flywheel.\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    outname = project.label.replace(' ', '_').replace('(', '').replace(')', '')\n",
    "    filename = f\"{outname}-{gear}-{gearVersion}-volumes.csv\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Concatenate and save DataFrame\n",
    "    df = pd.concat(df, axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n",
    "    outdir = Path(project_path) / filename\n",
    "    df.to_csv(outdir)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Uploads a file to the project information tab\n",

    "    print(\"Check that if analysis was run, and that there are results to upload\")\n",
    "    continue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Calculate Total Execution Time\n",
    "Finally, the script calculates and prints the total time taken to complete all processing.\n",
