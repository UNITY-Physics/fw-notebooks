    "### Step 2: Selecting and Downloading the Latest Gear Run Output in Flywheel\n",
    "\n",
    "This script retrieves the output of the latest (or second latest) run of a specified Flywheel \"gear\" (processing tool), making it available for local analysis within a Jupyter environment. Here’s an overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Project and Analysis Context**: The code starts by defining the project and retrieving all analyses associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Gear Name**: The specific gear name (in this case, `custom-information-sync`) is set to filter analyses. This ensures that only runs using this gear are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filter Analyses by Gear Name**: The script filters through all analyses to find those that match the specified gear name. This filtering is done in a case-insensitive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve Latest Gear Runs**: From the filtered list, it identifies the two most recent gear runs:\n",
    "   - **Latest Gear Run**: The most recent analysis run that matches the specified gear.\n",
    "   - **Second Latest Gear Run**: The second most recent run, used as a backup if the latest run is missing the required files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check for Files in the Latest Gear Run**: The script checks if the latest run has an output file:\n",
    "   - If the file is found, it proceeds with the latest run.\n",
    "   - If no file is found, it defaults to the second most recent run and logs a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Download the File Locally**: Once the appropriate file object is identified, it downloads the file to a specified directory within the Jupyter environment, ready for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script ensures that the most recent data from the specified gear run is readily accessible, with a fallback to a previous run if necessary.\n"

    "### Step 3: Syncing Local Data with Flywheel Session Information\n",
    "\n",
    "This script combines local demographic or variable data with session data from a Flywheel project, aligning information for seamless synchronization. Here’s an overview of its key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define File Paths**: The script defines file paths for accessing the local data (e.g., a demographics CSV file) and Flywheel session information CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Data**: It loads the local data (`df_local`) and Flywheel session data (`df_fw`) into separate dataframes. These dataframes contain information that will later be merged, such as participant demographics and session details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Align Identifiers**: The script renames columns in `df_local` to match those in Flywheel (`df_fw`). This alignment ensures that subject IDs and session IDs are consistent, enabling the data to be matched accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Merge Dataframes**: The `merge()` function combines `df_fw` and `df_local` based on shared identifiers (e.g., `subject_id`), allowing demographic data to be added to the Flywheel session data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Replace Data Where Needed**: For each relevant column, the script replaces Flywheel values with those from the local data if they are available. This allows updated or additional information from the local dataset to overwrite existing values in Flywheel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Clean Up Columns**: After merging, the script removes unnecessary columns (suffixes created by merging, like `_fw` and `_local`) to keep the dataframe clean and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Save the Merged Dataframe**: Finally, the script saves the merged and cleaned dataframe back to a CSV file, ready for uploading or further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process enables efficient synchronization of locally stored data with Flywheel, ensuring that session information is accurate and up-to-date.\n"

    "\n",
    "This final script cell uploads a processed file to Flywheel and initiates a new analysis job using a specified gear. Here’s an overview of the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upload the File to Flywheel**: The script uploads the prepared file (`file_str`) to the Flywheel project. It stores the uploaded file as `input_file`, which serves as an input reference for the gear analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select the Gear**: The `custom-information-sync` gear is retrieved from Flywheel, which will process the uploaded file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prepare Job Inputs**: The script sets up an `inputs` dictionary where `session_info` is linked to the uploaded file. This dictionary will pass the file as input to the gear.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Define Destination and Label for Analysis**: The analysis destination is set to the project level. The script generates a unique `analysis_label` using the current date and time, ensuring each run is clearly labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the Gear Analysis Job**:\n",
    "   - The script calls the gear’s `run` function, providing the label, inputs, destination, and an empty configuration.\n",
    "   - It stores the job ID in `job_list` and logs a message indicating that the job has been submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handle Errors**: If an error occurs during job submission, the script catches the exception and prints a warning with the specific error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code cell completes the workflow by initiating an analysis job in Flywheel, using the uploaded file as input, and tagging it for easy tracking.\n"
